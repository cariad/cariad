[cariad/wev](https://github.com/cariad/wev) is a cross-platform command-line tool for running commands _with environment variables_.

For example:

### s3headersetter 🎁

[s3headersetter](https://github.com/cariad/s3headersetter) is a cross-platform CLI tool for setting HTTP headers on Amazon Web Services S3 objects.

Simply create a configuration file to describe the headers and objects to match:

```yaml
rules:
  - header:        Cache-Control
    when:
      - extension: .html
        then:      max-age=3600, public
      - extension: .css
        then:      max-age=604800, public
    else:          max-age=31536000, public

  - header:        Content-Type
    when:
      - extension: .woff2
        then:      font/woff2
```

…then run `s3headersetter` to connect and update your objects:

```bash
s3headersetter -config config.yml -bucket my-website-bucket
```
