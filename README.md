# Cariad Eccleston 👩🏼‍💻 🏳️‍🌈 🏳️‍⚧️ 😷

Hey! I’m **Cariad**, pronounced "carry-add". I’m a **freelance DevOps engineer**, and I **work remotely** from the seaside in Exmouth, UK.

- 👩🏼‍💻 All about that **Python** and **Amazon Web Services**.
- 🧪 It ain’t done until it’s **tested**.
- 🏳️‍🌈 **Transgender**. Pronouns are **she/her**.
- 🤔 Working on my **presentation confidence** and **books**.
- 💬 Ask me about **any of my projects** and **contracting availability**.

## My values 💕

- 👩‍🏫 **Support your team to succeed without you.** Share your knowledge. Be a teacher, not a hoarder.
- 💥 **Fail early, fail often.** If you’re not failing, you’re not experimenting. If you're not experimenting, you're not innovating. If you're not innovating, the startup across the street will eat your lunch.
- ✌️ **Chill.** Empower folks to fix their own mistakes. Contribute without shaming. We all fuck up.
- ❤️ **Empathise.** The language we use with our colleagues is more important than the language we use in Visual Studio Code. Zero tolerance for bigotry.

## Recent contracts 🙋‍♀️

- 2020-2021: **[Freyda](https://freyda.io)**
    - Architect cloud infrastructure in **Amazon Web Services**.
    - Build and deploy infrastructure-as-code with **Python**.
    - Build and take care of the **CI/CD pipeline**.
    - Think about **encryption**, **serverless**, **scaling**, **monitoring**, **resilience** and **recovery**. _Y’know, the fun stuff!_
- 2020: **NHS Digital**, building .NET SOAP services and automated tests.

## Recent projects 🎉

### sitestack.cloud 🌍

With (almost) one-click, [sitestack.cloud](https://sitestack.cloud) deploys all the infrastructure you need to host a static website in your own Amazon Web Services account.

Just drag-and-drop your site into the S3 bucket we deploy, and it’s live behind **HTTPS**, a **global CDN** and **beautiful URLs**; no `index.html` on the end.

Perfect for Hugo, Jekyll and other static site generators!
